                <p> While Naruto does take a great selfie the thing that makes it one of the most influential animals of
                year is the legal presedent that came with the selfie. In almost all cases the copyright of a picture belongs to the person that 
                takes the picture. This means that if a celeberty has there picture taken by someone while out in public 
                they would need to get the copyright from the photographer even if they're the only person in it. This means that 
                before naruto's selfie the copyright of animal photographs unabligulusy belonged to the photographer.</p>
                <p> 
                    The legal issue around Naruto's picture is what who gets the copyright when an animal takes the picture. 
                    The image hosting site Wikimedia Commons argued that since Naruto took the picture he would be the one that is assigned the copyright, and since a non-human creater cannot hold copyright the photo belonged to the public domain.
                    PETA also jumped in to argue infavor of the macaque gaining the copyright.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    The courts agreed that the photo was infact in the public domain as a non-human creater was the photographer and when PETA sued that David Salter, the photographer whos camera was used for the photo, was not allowed to use the photo since the copyright actually belogned to the monkey. 
                    The result of that suit was that Salter would have to send 25% of the income gain from the picture to the resurve where the monkeys.
